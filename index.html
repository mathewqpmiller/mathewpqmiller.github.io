        <p>I am a student at University of Oregon where I study Data Analytics.  I currently have a full time job in construction and when I am not at work I am typically at the grocery store, at work on a home project or am relaxing to some music or a movie.  I hope to learn valuable skills at UofO that can be utilized at a fortune 500 tech company.</p>
        <p>I also have a passion for finance and plan to persue a dual undergraduate degree in Business Finance.  Currently I hold an undergraduate degree in Business Management. I just need to take a couple of more classes to reach this goal</p>
